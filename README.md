# HR-Analytics-in-Power-BI

In this Power BI case study, I will be exploring a dataset for a fictitious software company called Atlas Labs. This project focuses on importing, analyzing and visualizing Human Resources data in Power BI. I’ll carry out exploratory data analysis and will use DAX to help build powerful visualizations. I’ll finish my analysis by diving deeper into attrition and what factors impact attrition. This analysis will help the organization determine what action they will need to take to retain more employees. then finalize the case study by making design changes to the report that provides a clean, branded design.
